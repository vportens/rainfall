# Level1


## Information with Ghidra 

Ghidra show us that  the main function have a variable that is a string with a length of 76 : string var[76] and that var is send to gets.

Gets use stdin to fill the variable give it to it, so here if the input is greater than 76 caractere then there is a overflow.   
The overflow link to and address.  
Using buffer overflow pattern generator and gdb we can see that the overflow link to the address of the 4 combines caractere after the length max of the buffer.  

Here is the tricks : 
Because there is a function named run, that call systeme('/bin/sh'), and that function is store at an address,   
We are going to try to link the overflow addresse to the address of the function.  

To do so, python will be our great friends :)
So we gonna write a sting with 76caracteres of your choise and the last 4 need to be the address of the function run,
Run's addresse : 0x08048444
python function look like :
python -c 'print("A" * 76" + "\x44\x84\x04\x08")' > /tmp/file

All that in a file, then execute the file in level1 : cat /tmp/file - | ./level1
