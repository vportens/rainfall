# Use GDB | 

- First we see with  disass tab all function in the programme,  
there is a main
- In the main function we see atoi is call then the result is use in cmp with 0x1a7 --> 423 in hexa if true, it's call execv

## Use Ghidra

Using Ghidra we see that the main function is easly readable and is doing a comparaison between atoi(argv[1]) and 423.  
If these comparaison is true then it's excecuting a shell.
